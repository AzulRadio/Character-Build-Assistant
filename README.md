### Why do I write this script. 

The key to build any vivid characters is to add ample details. Thus, one should know his characters well. To help illustrators know their characters, I write this Q-A based character building assistant. It helps you get to know your character when you try to answer the questions about your characters. <br>
设定一个有深度的角色需要添加大量的细节，这需要作者对角色有充分的了解。所以我写了这个基于问答的建角色辅助脚本，旨在帮助作者们更加深入地了解自己的角色。

The Questions are selected from 2 questions libraries. One is about the character's daily life. For example, how will her react under certain circumstances.<br>
问题从两个题库中选择，一个关于角色的日常生活，比如她对特定的事件会怎样反应。

Besides a library about the character's daily life, there is also a library about the world the character lives in. For a chararcter living in a fantasy world, knowing the world your characters lives in is critical to character building. Try to think of how your characters interact with their surroundings and how the environment shapes their bodies and minds. This will help build more convincing figures.<br>
另一个则是关于角色所生活的世界。对于一个生活在非现实世界中的角色，了解角色生活的世界对角色塑造也是必要的。试着想象你的角色怎样和周边环境互动，他们生活的世界又怎样改变了他们的身心。
